# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
The main goal of this machine learning project is to build a recommendation engine that recommends movies to users.
This R project is designed to understand the functioning of how a recommendation system works. 
We will be developing an Item Based Collaborative Filter.

## What is a Recommendation System?
A recommendation system provides suggestions to the users through a filtering process that is based on user preferences and browsing history. 
The information about the user is taken as an input. The information is taken from the input that is in the form of browsing data. 
This information reflects the prior usage of the product as well as the assigned ratings. 
A recommendation system is a platform that provides its users with various contents based on their preferences and likings. 
A recommendation system takes the information about the user as an input.

There are two types of recommendation systems 
  â€“ Content-Based Recommendation System and 
  - Collaborative Filtering Recommendation. 

In this project of recommendation system in R, we will work on a collaborative filtering recommendation system and more specifically, ITEM based collaborative recommendation system.

## Steps Involved in Building Movie Recommendation System
1. Import Dataset and Necessary Libraries
2. Data Pre-processing
3. Visualization 
   - "Most Viewed Movies"
   -  Heatmap of Movie Ratings
4. Performing Data Preparation
   - Selecting useful data.
   - Normalizing data.
   - Binarizing the data.
5. Collaborative Filtering System
6. Building the Recommendation System using R

## Summary
Recommendation Systems are the most popular type of machine learning applications that are used in all sectors. They are an improvement over the traditional classification algorithms as they can take many classes of input and provide similarity ranking based algorithms to provide the user with accurate results.
