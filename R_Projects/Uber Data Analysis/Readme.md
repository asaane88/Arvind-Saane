# Uber Data Analysis Project

## Overview
In this project, we will analyze the Uber Pickups in New York City dataset. 
This is more of a data visualization project that will guide you towards using the ggplot2 library for understanding the data and for developing an intuition for understanding the customers who avail the trips. With the help of visualization, companies can avail the benefit of understanding the complex data and gain insights that would help them to craft decisions.

## Steps Involved in Uber Data Analysis Project
1. Importing Essential Packages
   * ggplot2
   * ggthemes
   * lubridate
   * dplyr
   * tidyr
   * DT
   * scales
2. Creating vector of colors to be implemented in our plots
3. Reading the Data into their designated variables
   * Plotting the trips by the hours in a day
   * Plotting data by trips during every day of the month
   * Number of Trips taking place during months in a year
   * Finding out the number of Trips by bases
4. Creating a Heatmap visualization of day, hour and month
   * **First**, we will plot Heatmap by Hour and Day.
   * **Second**, we will plot Heatmap by Month and Day.
   * **Third**, a Heatmap by Month and Day of the Week.
   * **Fourth**, a Heatmap that delineates Month and Bases.
   * **Finally**, we will plot the heatmap, by bases and day of the week.
5. Creating a map visualization of rides in New York

## Summary
At the end of the Uber data analysis R project, we observed how to create data visualizations. 
We made use of packages like ggplot2 that allowed us to plot various types of visualizations that pertained to several time-frames of the year. 
With this, we could conclude how time affected customer trips. 
Finally, we made a geo plot of New York that provided us with the details of how various users made trips from different bases.
