# Credit Card Fraud with Machine Learning in R

## Overview
We will go through the various algorithms like Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks and finally, Gradient Boosting Classifier. 
For carrying out the credit card fraud detection, we will make use of the Card Transactions dataset that contains a mix of fraud as well as non-fraudulent transactions.

### Steps Involved in Credit Card Fraud Detection
1. Importing the Datasets
2. Data Exploration
3. Data Manipulation
4. Data Modeling
5. Fitting Logistic Regression Model
6. Fitting a Decision Tree Model
7. Artificial Neural Network
8. Gradient Boosting (GBM)

### Summary
Achieved a GBM _AUC Score of 0.9555 for the model.
