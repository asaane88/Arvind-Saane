## What are Sales and Marketing Analytics?

As defined by SAS, “Marketing analytics comprises the processes and technologies that enable marketers to evaluate the success of their marketing initiatives by measuring performance (e.g., blogging versus social media versus channel communications) using important business metrics, such as ROI, marketing attribution and overall marketing effectiveness. 
In other words, it tells you how your marketing programs are really performing.” Wordstream defines Marketing Analytics as, “The practice of measuring, managing and analyzing marketing performance to maximize its effectiveness and optimize return on investment (ROI). 
Understanding marketing analytics allows marketers to be more efficient at their jobs and minimize wasted web marketing dollars. 
Beyond the obvious sales and lead generation applications, marketing analytics can offer profound insights into customer preferences and trends. Despite these compelling benefits, a majority of organizations fail to ever realize the promises of marketing analytics. 
According to a survey of senior marketing executives published in the Harvard Business Review, ‘more than 80% of respondents were dissatisfied with their ability to measure marketing ROI.'”
