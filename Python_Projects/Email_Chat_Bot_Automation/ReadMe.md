This is a Email Automation using speech recognition("MicroPhone") as an input to the program to send an email to sender. 
This Program will listen to the user input and ask for details like "Sender Name", "Subjectline", "Body of email". 
So If You want to sent multiple emails with different content, you need not type long emails.

The reference for this project is taken from ProgrammingHero1.
